## Start a development environment
Yes, Darryl. We know. You already told us how!
But, let me repeat myself.

Navigate into dir with package.json 
```
cd frontend
```
Install dependencies (this is a habit I developed over time)
```
npm install
```
Run environment 
```
npm start
```

## Good/Must-have Habits 
These habits are good to have and some are must to have to mitigate the headache from debugging dependencies-related issues and things like that.

Everytime you want to install a new dependency, PLEASE SAVE IT TO `package.json`.
```
npm install --save <PACKAGE_NAME>
```
